# ProgrammingAbstractMath

This is a simplified version of the Abstract Math Task. Typically in our lab, participants watch a series of rule videos as well as a series of instructional videos to learn a novel math system that uses shapes instead of numbers.

However, the video files were too large for GitHub, so I had to modify the task. I was only able to upload three of the six rule videos that were short enough in duration. I was not able to upload any of the instructional videos since those are longer in duration.

In this task, participants first watch the three rule videos. Then, they solve six practice problems.

After solving practice problems, they are instructed to answer more problems. They solve eight instructional problems.

Finally, participants are given instructions to answer more problems. They solve 35 posttest problems that range in complexity.

At the end, participants are thanked for their time and are notified that they are done with the task.

Performance on the math questions is calculated to assess math learning. I calculated overall proportion scores as well as proportion scores for the practice problems, the instructional problems, and the posttest problems separately.
